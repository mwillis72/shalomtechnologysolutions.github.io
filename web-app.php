    Responsive Web Development
    </h2>

    <p style="font-size:20px; padding:7px;"> 
    The number of devices that people use on a daily basis is increasing by leaps and bounds.</p>

    <p style="font-size:20px; padding:7px;"> 
    With our team of expert developers, all the web applications we build are responsive. 
    This means they look great and work perfectly on any screen of any size; desktop, table or smartphone. 
    We do this by adapting menus, controls and other visuals to fit the device based on the current screen width
     and height, ensuring the user always gets the best possible experience regardless of what device they’re using.</p>
