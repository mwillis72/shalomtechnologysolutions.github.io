    <h2 style="color:black;">Transform your engineering projects</h2>
    <p style="font-size:18px; padding:10px;"> 
    Intelligent engineering software is a powerful tool that allows your business to operate more efficiently – and 
    with fewer resources. We can help you simplify your access to complex data by building custom interfaces that 
    visualise and analyse a wide range of complex inputs, from sensors, precision machines, files or just GUI input, 
    and provide the relevant outputs, be it mathematical calculations, visualisations (graphs, 3D models or real-time 
    display), mapping systems and much more.</p>

    <p style="font-size:21px; color:red;">We can help you...</p>

    <ul style="font-size:18px;">
    <li> <strong>Rewrite and modernise out-dated software,</strong> often originally developed by hardware engineers. This often involves 
    creating web and mobile apps, or even new desktop software (compatible with Windows and/or Mac) to create something 
    intuitive and great looking to impress users and clients.</li>
    
    <li> <strong>Visualise complex calculated data</strong> for providing information and insight to your 
    organisation’s users or the general public.</li>

    <li> <strong>Measure and analyse the performance</strong> of production and output, using systems 
    that bring together composite or aggregated data from different sources.</li>
    
    <li> <strong>Design engineering solutions</strong> using software interfaces that are fully aligned 
    with your design processes, making them much more efficient.</li>
    
    </ul>

    <p style="font-size:18px; padding:10px; color:black;"> 
    We discover everything there is to learn about your business, what a new app needs to deliver and to whom. 
    If you’d like us to, we’ll also suggest a few of our own ideas – we love coming up with fresh solutions that 
    really make the technology work hard.</p>

    Benefits of Custom Software
    </h2>

    <p style="font-size:20px; padding:10px;"> 
    There are clearly benefits both for custom software and "off-the-shelf" solutions. By choosing custom software 
    development from Syberry, you'll enjoy numerous advantages of a custom system, tailored for your business. </p>

    <ul style="font-size:18px;">
    <li> <strong>Full Ownership</strong> </li>
    <p>Syberry customers own 100% of their software, so you'll never pay subscription or royalty fees. Want to add 
    another feature or more users? No problem; you have all the control.</p>
    
    <li> <strong>Full Flexibility</strong> </li>
    <p>With a custom-built Syberry solution, you can do whatever you want whenever you want with your product. 
    That means your software can grow and change with your business, not the other way around.</p>

    <li> <strong>Competitive Advantages</strong> </li>
    <p>Unlike "off-the-shelf" software, a custom-built Syberry solution can boost your company's performance and 
    be a valuable IP asset, two strong competitive advantages.</p>
    
    <li> <strong>Technology Independent</strong></li>
    <p>Syberry is a technology-agnostic company. In other words, we don't sell or promote specific technologies, 
    so we're 100% focused on our customers. We pick the right stack for your unique business needs and goals.</p>
