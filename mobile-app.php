    What are mobile apps?
    </h2>

    <p style="font-size:20px; padding:10px;"> 
    A mobile application or ‘app’ is a type of software designed to run on a mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet. They are different to mobile-optimised 
    websites because they are designed to run on the native device, utilising device hardware such as the camera or accelerometer. 
    They are usually distributed via the Apple App Store for iPhones & iPads, or Google Play for Android mobile and tablet devices.</p>

    There’s no question that a strategically conceived mobile app can reap massive rewards when it comes to engaging with your customers or users,
    <br> but with most people expecting a mobile app
    to be easier to use than a website or desktop application, it’s important that it’s up to scratch – and that’s where we step in.

    We’ll help you not only envisage the concept behind the mobile app, but provide a complete focus on the user-experience, as well as building

    Purpose of a Mobile App.
    </h2>

    <p style="font-size:20px; padding:10px;"> 
    A mobile app enables users to access software from their smartphone or tablet device. Mobile apps load faster and function more smoothly 
    than mobile browsers, resulting in a better user experience. Businesses are using mobile apps to improve their processes and accessibility 
    for their customers. They are also easy to find and install from the Apple and Google app stores.</p>

    Benefits of a mobile app
    </h2>

    <p style="font-size:18px; padding:10px;"> 
    It’s important to us that you get the right app for your needs, objectives and budget. So why build an app?</p>

    <ul style="font-size:18px;">
    <li>Minimal Limitations</li>
    <p style="font-size:18px; padding:10px; color:black;"> 
        They aren’t limited by a browser and can be used offline.</p>

    <li>Interactivity</li>
    <p style="font-size:18px; padding:10px; color:black;"> 
        Native apps can be built to interact with all the features that the phone offers like accelerometer, the camera and GPS.</p>
    <li>Excellent User Experience</li>
    <p style="font-size:18px; padding:10px; color:black;"> 
        Mobile apps load and function quicker and more smoothly than mobile browsers or desktop computers.</p>
        <li>Wide Reach</li>
    <p style="font-size:18px; padding:10px; color:black;"> 
    Your app will reside on the Apple App Store and Google Play, so you’ll automatically be getting your app in front of people whose intent is to download an app.</p>
    <li>Stickiness</li>
    <p style="font-size:18px; padding:10px; color:black;"> 
    When using a mobile app, visitors tend to spend 3-4 times longer online than they would using a mobile site.</p>
